The **"Universal Network"** is an open source, decentralized, creator first video sharing platform <br />

## Goal
This is a personal research project to explore **Web 3.0** technology and the potential to lower overhead costs for web applications, however, if you're interested feel free to contribute. <br />
The goal is to make a system so affordable to operate that creators can recieve 100% of their video ad profits. The app should not be any more complicated to access or use than any competing Web 2.0 apps.

## Why
Current Web 3.0 apps prioritize ridding their platform of ads, moderation, or both. All of which hurts and turns away creators and their viewers. <br />
Current Web 2.0 platforms tend to have frustrating algorithms and revolving systems and policies. All of which hurts and turns away creators and their viewers. <br />
What we need is a happy middle ground that promotes AI minimalism, opperational transparency, and online safety. Web 3.0 should allow us to create a platform with less overhead costs leading to *less* ads and more creator profits.

## Tech Stack
I expect the tech stake to utilize the following:
1. [**IPFS:**](https://github.com/ipfs/ipfs) For file storage and possibly metadata in JSON format. We will develop a custom pinning network to store data.
2. [**Bacalhau:**](https://github.com/bacalhau-project/bacalhau) For computation and backend.
3. [**SKALE:**](https://skale.space/) (**Maybe**) If affordable a blockchain could be useful for user identification and metadata storage.
4. **React & TypeScript:** For web app development.
5. **Python:** For backend and AI development.
6. **Ad Provider:** (**Unkown**) Need to find an ad provider that can integrate into UNet and will allow creators to get paid directly by the service.
